  summary: 'A tool for the generation of events in high-energy collisions'
  description: |
      The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of events in
      high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for
      the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multiparticle
      final state. It contains a library of hard processes, models for initial-
      and final-state parton showers, matching and merging methods between hard
      processes and parton showers, multiparton interactions, beam remnants,
      string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities
      and several interfaces to external programs.
